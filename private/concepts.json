About 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight is a good rule of thumb. Good nutrition requires planning out your meals and preparing them yourself, as well as restricting restaurant visits.

Compound barbell lifts are a good starting place, but may have a limiting fatigue to stimulus ratio as you get more advanced. Adding weight to the bar, or reps to the set, or sets to the session or in some way making the muscle stimulus increase from session to session, and week to week is fundamental to building muscle. Varying exercise selection is important in order to activate the full range of muscle fibers. Deloading is often necessary for intermediate and advanceed trainees.",
