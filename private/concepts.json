  {"_id":"4","name":"Nutrition","text":"Good nutrition means eating the correct number of calories, from food sources which give you the correct grams of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. About 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight is a good rule of thumb. Good nutrition requires planning out your meals and preparing them yourself, as well as restricting restaurant visits. Supplements beyond multivitiamins and creatine and whey protein and caffeine are generally a waste of money."},
  {"_id":"5","name":"Training","text":"Good training means lifting enough sets of heavy enough weights enough times per week to stimulate the muscles so that they grow. Compound barbell lifts are a good starting place, but may have a limiting fatigue to stimulus ratio as you get more advanced. Adding weight to the bar, or reps to the set, or sets to the session or in some way making the muscle stimulus increase from session to session, and week to week is fundamental to building muscle. Varying exercise selection is important in order to activate the full range of muscle fibers. Deloading is often necessary for intermediate and advanceed trainees."},
  {"_id":"6","name":"Recovery","text":"Good recovery means sleeping 7.5-9 hours per day, and keeping your stress levels low. Setting a regular bedtime and sticking to it is good. Naps are good. Prayer or meditation is good. Stretching, foam-rolling, massages, hot baths, music, journalling, or other legitimately relaxing activities are good."}
